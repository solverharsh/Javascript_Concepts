‚û°Creation of the Global Execution Context:

When a JavaScript program starts running, it creates the global execution context. This context consists of two phases: the memory phase and the execution phase.

‚û°Memory Phase:

During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine sets up the global object (which is the window object in a browser environment), the 'this' keyword, and the outer environment reference.
It also scans through the code and sets up memory space for variables and functions through a process called "hoisting." Variables are set to undefined, and functions are stored in their entirety.

‚û°Execution Phase:

After the creation phase, the execution phase begins. This is where the actual code is executed line by line.

‚û°Function Execution:

When a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function. This includes its own memory space for variables and parameters.
The function goes through its own creation and execution phases.
After the function finishes executing, its execution context is popped off the call stack.

‚û°Call Stack:

The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of the program. It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
As functions are called, their execution contexts are added to the top of the call stack.
When a function completes its execution, its context is removed from the top of the call stack.

‚û°Global Execution Completion:

Once the global execution context completes, the program finishes its execution.

üìùNote: 
 The returned value being passed to the global environment, it's more accurate to say that the returned value is passed to the calling context. If a function is called within another function, the returned value is typically used in the context of the calling function.
